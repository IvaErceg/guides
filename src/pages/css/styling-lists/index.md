## Styling Lists
List specific properties are list-style-type, list-style-position and list-style-image. List-style-type controlls type of bullets used for a list (square, circle, numbers, none...). List-style-position controlls whether bullets appear inside the list items, or outside them. List-style-image allows for use of a custom images in place of bullets. There is a shorthand property list-style, by which you can set all these properties at the same time.
